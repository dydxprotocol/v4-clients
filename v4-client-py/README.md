## Running tests

Integration tests uses testnet environment for testing. We use pytest.

To install pytest

```
pip install pytest
```

For read-only integration tests, run:

```
pytest -v
```

For integration tests with transactions, a subaccount must exist for the specified address.
This subaccount may be reset when testnet environment is reset. To create the subaccount, run

examples/faucet_endpoint.py

Wait for a few seconds for the faucet transaction to commit, then run

```
pytest -v -c pytest_integration.ini 
```
