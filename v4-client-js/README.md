The v4-Client Typescript client is used for placing transactions and querying the dYdX chain.

## Development

`v4-client-js` uses node `v18` for development. You can use `nvm` to manage different versions of node.

```
nvm install
nvm use
nvm alias default $(nvm version) # optional
```

You can run the following commands to ensure that you are running the correct `node` and `npm` versions.

```
node -v # expected: v18.x.x (should match .nvmrc)
npm -v  # expected: 8.x.x
```

## Single-JS for mobile apps

Mobile apps needs to load JS as a single JS file. To build, run

```
npm run webpack
```

The file is generated in **native**/**ios**/v4-native-client.js
Pending: Different configurations may be needed to generate JS for Android app

## Release

Using the `npm version` command will update the appropriate version tags within the package locks and also will add a git tag with the version number..
For example `npm version minor` will perform the necessary changes for a minor version release. After the change is merged, a GitHub action will
[publish](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients/blob/master/.github/workflows/js-publish.yml) the new release.
