### Quick Start

To place an order, you first need to build the order. Here's a basic overview of the process:

1. Set up your network connection (see [Network Setup](./documentation/network_setup.md))
2. If using testnet, obtain funds from the faucet (see [Using the Testnet Faucet](./documentation/using_testnet_faucet.md))
3. Check your account details (see [Account Details](./documentation/account_details.md))
4. Get current market prices (see [Getting Price Quotes](./documentation/getting_price_quotes.md))
5. Build and place your order (see [Placing Orders](./placing_orders.md) or [Placing Native Orders](./documentation/placing_native_orders.md))
6. Optionally, set up WebSocket connections for real-time updates (see [Using WebSockets](./documentation/using_websockets.md))

For more detailed examples, see the [examples directory](/examples). Note that some examples may require installation of additional packages to work.

## Changes

### Migration

If you are transitioning from a previous version of the Python client, please note the following differences:

#### NodeClient

`ValidatorClient` is renamed to `NodeClient`.

All provided methods are asynchronous.

Methods are available directly, no methods `get` or `post` needed, since the client uses inheritance, and consists of three layers:

- `QueryNodeClient`, the basic layer that send queries to a node
- `MutatingNodeClient` - the extension on top of the query client, that support transation simulation and sending
- `NodeClient` the toppest layer that provides methods to control orders

For parameters raw types used.

For construcint order the `Market` builder is provided, that helps to calculate quantums and subticks values.

#### IndexerClient

The `IndexerClient` has the similar structure, but provides
asynchronous methods as well.

#### IndexerSocket

The `SocketClient` is replaced with the `IndexerSocket` that provides separate channels concept and allow to add per-channel processing.

### Key Improvements

The latest version of the Python async client for dYdX offers notable enhancements over previous iterations. These improvements make it a more efficient tool for trading and integration.

#### Asynchronous Execution

The methods leverage Python's async features, allowing you to fully harness concurrency benefits. This approach optimizes resource usage, minimizes unnecessary threads, and reduces latency.

#### Enhanced Type Hints

Expanded type hint coverage enhances code readability and provides better tooling support. Additionally, it helps detect errors early during development.

#### API Reflection

The client closely mirrors the dYdX API, enabling seamless access to the exchange's features and parameters. This makes integrating the client with your applications intuitive and straightforward.

#### Lightweight Implementation
The client is built using pure Python libraries and maintains a thin, transparent layer that follows the Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA). This ensures explicit behavior and gives you greater control.

#### MIT License
Licensed under the permissive MIT license, the client can be easily integrated into your software projects without restrictive legal hurdles.

## Development
The project is divided into three main parts:
* node - contains the `NodeClient`, transaction builder and other utilities
* indexer - contains rest api indexer client and websocket indexer client
* faucet - contains faucet client

### Installing from source
The project employs [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/). To install dependencies, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Preparing development environment
Install git hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Testing
To run tests use:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
